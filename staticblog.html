<p>This blog started out on WordPress. I like WordPress! Or, I
<em>liked</em> WordPress. Ever since 5.0 introduced the Gutenberg
block-based editor, WordPress has given up on being a blogging platform
in favour of competing with Wix and SquareSpace as a general web
publishing tool with WYSIWYG editing. That’s nice for web design shops
selling trendy landing pages to business, but it sucks for anyone who
just wants a blog.</p>
<p>After tiring of wrestling Gutenberg, I wrote <a
href="https://github.com/Midnight-Salmon/scrumble">scrumble</a>.
Scrumble is a static site generator. It takes a folder full of Markdown
files representing blog posts and top-level pages and generates a blog
in simple semantic HTML and CSS. I wrote my own SSG rather than use an
existing one because they all seem to have the same problem as
post-Gutenberg WordPress: they want to support the creation of any
hypothetical website, with any layout. Off-the-shelf SSGs do this via
complex templating systems rather than a fiddly web interface. I don’t
want either! Scrumble is simple: Markdown goes in, website comes out. It
generates exactly one kind of website: mine.</p>
<p>That’s the main reason for scrumble’s existence. Another is security.
I’m not one of those people who considers WordPress fundamentally
insecure. After all, it’s good enough for the White House. However, in
my day job, I see compromised WordPress sites almost every day. This is
almost always thanks to vulnerabilities in plugins, an issue I avoided
on my own WordPress site by just not having any plugins. A static site
is of course invulnerable to anything short of an attacker gaining
access to the hosting backend.</p>
<p>A blog is really the simplest kind of website. Unless you’re a
national news outlet, you really don’t need a CMS. Plain text files and
a script with a goofy name are more than enough.</p>
