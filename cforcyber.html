<p>If you take a look at the “security” topic on GitHub today you’ll
find my beloved C relegated to the bottom of the language rankings.
Python dominates by far, Go is on the rise, but C (the best language) is
slumming it with TypeScript. This isn’t exactly a scientific measurement
of language relevance in the industry (Ruby should be in there
somewhere, thanks to Metasploit) but it suggests a painful truth: C
isn’t cool anymore.</p>
<p>C should still be cool. Consider the <a
href="https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/#kali-tools-top10">Kali top
10</a>: more than half of those essential tools are written in C.
Outside the top 10 there’s still a lot of C. Sure, there are good
reasons to use more modern languages for security tooling: they make
picking information out of strings much easier, they have nice
abstractions for networking… but I spent years writing Python and
decided I didn’t like it all that much. I bounced off Go violently, and
if you see me writing TypeScript I’ve been kidnapped and replaced by an
evil clone with questionable taste. Why not write new tools in C? It was
good enough for Nmap in 1997 (as a <a
href="https://nmap.org/p51-11.html">single ~2000-line source file</a>).
How hard could it be? Let’s build a port scanner.</p>
<h2 id="that-went-well">That Went Well</h2>
<p>There I was, looking with satisfaction at the recently-uploaded v1.0
build of my new port scanner, ready to write about what a breezy
experience it was building it in C. Who needs dynamic typing? Who needs
memory safety? C is straightforward and explicit, and everything just…
Hey, why can’t I scan my loopback address?</p>
<p>Yup, IPv6 connections were completely broken. Not only would the
connection fail, but the addresses wouldn’t even print to the terminal
correctly. The latter was an easy fix; I had a buffer sized for IPv4
addresses because I used the wrong constant. The connection issue took
some diagnosing. More on that later. Eventually, though, with the help
of my trusty GNU debugger and Microsoft’s surprisingly decent Win32 API
documentation, I fixed it. That was really the only hurdle I
encountered. Sure, the final product isn’t going to take on Nmap any
time soon. But it’s fully functional and under 500 lines of code. I’m
not convinced it would have been any easier in a higher-level language
with a trendy dynamic type system.</p>
<h2 id="the-nightmare-union-from-hell">The Nightmare Union from
Hell</h2>
<p>Time for some technical bits. My toy port scanner, which I’ve named
<a href="https://github.com/Midnight-Salmon/recce-mission">Recce
Mission</a>, uses Winsock2 – Microsoft’s implementation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley sockets
API</a>. Every modern OS provides something similar; it’s the standard
interface for user space network access. It’s not a strict standard,
though: outside of POSIX it’s not a standard at all. The capabilities
provided by a socket API depend entirely on the platform. This is why
Recce Mission is a Windows program specifically. On Windows, access to
raw sockets (sockets that bypass the platform’s TCP/IP stack) is
restricted. Not so on POSIX-compliant, POSIX-adjacent, POSIX-ish
systems. Raw sockets are what you need in order to perform the more
clever <a href="https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods.html">port scanning
techniques</a> like stealth scans and idle scans with zombie hosts.</p>
<p>Because of this platform limitation, Nmap on Windows requires a
custom network driver and some complex manual construction of ethernet
frames. Recce Mission uses only what the platform provides and therefore
requires no installation of custom drivers, no registry changes, and no
elevated user permissions.</p>
<p>This leads us to what I think is my fundamental point when it comes
to higher-level, supposedly cross-platform scripting languages used for
cybersecurity: no matter what, you cannot escape the platform. No matter
what language you use, your user space networking will use the
platform-provided sockets API. Make the interface as friendly and
object-oriented as you want, deep down it’s still Winsock2 and you still
don’t have raw sockets.</p>
<p>I’ll give the scripting languages one thing: they usually give you a
way to avoid the cursed knowledge I’m about to inflict on you. Remember
my IPv6 problem? That surprised me, because I wrote the code to be
address family-independent from the beginning. In the Berkeley sockets
API this is achieved through a hellish system of structs containing
pointers to structs containing pointers to more structs, type punning by
abusing the memory layout of those structs and, on Windows, a union
described in the more-or-less canonical <a
href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/ip-addresses-structs-and-data-munging.html#structs">Beej’s
Guide</a> as “God-awful” and “one of the scariest unions of all time.”
Languages with dynamic typing and inheritance give you a variety of
options for dodging this nightmare. It’s still there of course, lurking
deep in the interpreter, but it’s wrapped in something friendly.</p>
<p>Here’s the offending code:</p>
<pre><code>static void *scan_port(void *a) {
  struct ScanThreadArgs *args = (struct ScanThreadArgs *)a;
  struct addrinfo *target_info = args-&gt;target_info;
  unsigned short port = args-&gt;port;
  enum PortState *destination = args-&gt;destination;
  struct sockaddr new_addr = *(target_info-&gt;ai_addr);
  struct sockaddr_in *new_addr_v4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)&amp;new_addr;
  new_addr_v4-&gt;sin_port = htons(port);
  ...</code></pre>
<p>“Aha! You’re accessing the address as if it’s always IPv4! There’s
your issue!”</p>
<p>No, that’s fine actually. You can totally do that. The memory layout
lines up, so the port number is in the same location no matter which of
the pointer types you access it through. The issue is with copying data
from target_info-&gt;ai_addr to a sockaddr. The ai_addr struct member
is, on paper, of type (struct sockaddr *). Says so right in the
documentation. In reality, it points to either a struct sockaddr_in or a
struct sockaddr_in6 depending on the address family. The sockaddr struct
isn’t actually big enough to hold an IPv6 address. So, even though
that’s the type used in the addrinfo declaration, actually using it that
way will truncate IPv6 addresses. If I was passing on ai_addr directly,
instead of messing with the contents to scan multiple ports without
multiple hostname resolutions, I wouldn’t have even noticed this. The
corrected code is arguably nicer, too:</p>
<pre><code>static void *scan_port(void *a) {
  struct ScanThreadArgs *args = (struct ScanThreadArgs *)a;
  struct addrinfo *target_info = args-&gt;target_info;
  unsigned short port = args-&gt;port;
  enum PortState *destination = args-&gt;destination;

  /* Copy address to correct format, set port. */
  
  void *new_addr = NULL;
  if (target_info-&gt;ai_family == AF_INET) {
    struct sockaddr_in new_addr4;
    new_addr4 = *((struct sockaddr_in*)(target_info-&gt;ai_addr));
    new_addr4.sin_port = htons(port);
    new_addr = &amp;new_addr4;
  }

  else {
    struct sockaddr_in6 new_addr6;
    new_addr6 = *((struct sockaddr_in6*)(target_info-&gt;ai_addr));
    new_addr6.sin6_port = htons(port);
    new_addr = &amp;new_addr6;
  }
...</code></pre>
<p>Well. That wasn’t so bad. Right, moving on! Except we’re not, because
that code has a problem. When compiled without optimisation flags it
works fine. Turn on the optimiser, though, and <a
href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html">nasal
demons</a> are unleashed. Rookie mistake! Spot the difference:</p>
<pre><code>static void *scan_port(void *a) {
  struct ScanThreadArgs *args = (struct ScanThreadArgs *)a;
  struct addrinfo *target_info = args-&gt;target_info;
  unsigned short port = args-&gt;port;
  enum PortState *destination = args-&gt;destination;

  /* Copy address to correct format, set port. */
  
  void *new_addr = NULL;
  struct sockaddr_in new_addr4;
  struct sockaddr_in6 new_addr6;
  if (target_info-&gt;ai_family == AF_INET) {
    new_addr4 = *(struct sockaddr_in *)(target_info-&gt;ai_addr);
    new_addr4.sin_port = htons(port);
    new_addr = &amp;new_addr4;
  }

  else {
    new_addr6 = *(struct sockaddr_in6 *)(target_info-&gt;ai_addr);
    new_addr6.sin6_port = htons(port); new_addr = &amp;new_addr6;
  }
...</code></pre>
<p>I declared new_addr4 and new_addr6 inside a block, leaving them to go
out of scope with new_addr still pointing to the address one of them
occupied, thus ruining my evening. I was so convinced the problem was
something much more esoteric that at one point I was combing through the
assembly in a sleep-deprived haze. Turns out the problem was boring and
stupid. Truly the quintessential C experience.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-outta-here">Let’s Get Outta Here</h2>
<p>So, okay, that thing with the type punning was pretty bad, and
admittedly it wouldn’t have happened had I been using a… No, wait, what
am I saying? What am I gonna do, write Python from now on? Fat chance.
I’ve learned nothing. C forever!</p>
